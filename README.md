# Top TV

This is my submission for William Hill's code test.

The mission was to make a landing page for a TV show. In my submission, I made 100 landing pages.

I focused on architecture choices to optimize performance. The home page has a Lighthouse performance score of **97** out of 100. Each show page has a performance score of **95** of 100.
